        I am software developer, a hobby turned passion that has beautifully consumed countless of my life, not complaining  :). <br><br>
        My current focus/obsession is the Scala programming language and the Light-bend ecosystem build around it (Akka - Play! - Slick).<br><br>
        This little site serves as my programming  career journal, where Iâ€™ll share my thought process as I got about solving many different problems. <br><br>
        My posts will cover domains ranging from cloud computing to data structure implementation and even API development (I like making little libraries). <br><br>
        Stay tuned and I hope you enjoy your time in my mini web-hut. Thanks! """))))
